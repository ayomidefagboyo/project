# Compazz - The Pitch

**The Product**

A friend currently runs a supermarket and restaurant and finds it tough to keep track of his money flow in terms of invoices, expenses, and EODs. So I built Compazz.

Compazz is an AI-powered business intelligence tool that transforms how restaurant and retail owners manage their finances. Upload your receipts, log your EODs, and you'll get real-time cash flow auditing with conversational insights. Think "QuickBooks meets ChatGPT" but actually built for small business owners who don't have accounting degrees.

**The Market**

Small business financial management is broken. ~60% of restaurants fail due to poor financial tracking, yet existing tools are either too complex (QuickBooks) or too basic (spreadsheets).

There's a huge market for business owners who want to understand their money without needing a CPA on payroll.

**Product Analysis / Competition**

QuickBooks is powerful but charges $50-200/month and requires training. That's literally 5-10x what we charge for way more complexity than most small businesses need.

Other competitors like Wave are "free" but nickel-and-dime you with payment processing fees and lack real intelligence.

Differentiator: AI-powered insights + simplicity + price. No accounting knowledge required, no enterprise complexity, no bullshit.

**Stage**

Fully working product with AI anomaly detection, not a half-baked MVP.

50+ local businesses already using it, catching $180K+ in financial discrepancies they would have missed.

Payment integration live, customers paying monthly and actually sticking around.

**Customer Conversion Strategy**

Targeting small restaurant/retail owners through word-of-mouth and local business networks.

Organic growth: business owners sharing how they caught staff theft or found inflated supplier invoices.

Sweet spot: owners who want to grow but are drowning in financial paperwork they don't understand.

**Why Us?**

I watched my friend struggle with this exact problem every single night. Built this because existing solutions suck for small businesses.

We're lean, fast, and focused on making financial intelligence accessible, not just a luxury for big corporations with CFOs.

**TL;DR:** Compazz gives small business owners AI-powered financial insights for $29/month, compared to $50-200+ from QuickBooks. It's fully working, live with payments, and already helping owners catch theft and grow revenue.

So... what's the verdict? Am I just building a "simpler QuickBooks" destined to be ignored? Or could there actually be a lane here for the scrappy underdog who actually understands small business pain? Roast me.
